### Chapter 1
# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

### Reliability
Tolerating hardware and software faults

### Scalability
Measuring load and performance. Latency percentiles, throughput

### Maintainability
Operability, simplicity & evolvability

### Data Intensive Applications
Many applications today are data-intesive than compute-intesive. Bigger problems are amount of data, complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.

#### Building Blocks:
- Databases - Store data to access/find later on
- Caches - Remember the result of an expensive operation for faster reads
- Search Indexes - Search/filter data by keyword
- Stream Processing - Send a message to another process to be handled asynchronously
- Batch Processing - Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data
