### Why I read this:
Other than systems design is usually asked in job interviews, learning to design good systems is very important for engineers as their applications grow while keeping it reliable, scalable and maintainable.

It's also good to understand how different tools/systems/services are built for in order to provide more sound solutions to different problems.
